# What is vGPU?

Nvidia vGPU is a proprietary technology developed by Nvidia for use in the data center with certain Tesla and Quadro cards. The technology is aimed at the VDI (Virtual Desktop Infrastructure) market, with the intention of remote users using a remote desktop solution to carry out work. Different remote applications include CAD/CAM software, gaming (think: GeForce Now), architecture, and many other graphics accelerated programs.

The information in this wiki will assist in using vGPU features on consumer GPUs such as GeForce and Quadro series cards. Using vGPU on unsupported hardware (such as this) is not recommended, but the tools/documentation provided here will still enable certain cards to run the technology.
